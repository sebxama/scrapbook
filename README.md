I'm Sebastian Samaruga, software developer from Buenos Aires, Argentina. I'm currently mildly seasoned in the development of business applications in the Java platform and related technologies and stacks.
But what has got me scratching my head a lot in the last couple of years is the "Semantic Web". I know it is a technology paradigm far away from it's realization. But, perhaps, with the advent of Big Data and such it could finally find its niche.
Meanwhile I dump all my head scratching thoughts into this blog and a related GitHub repository I'd like to share. It is an endless work in progress draft and a scrapbook of spare assorted ideas waiting to be realized...

Note: This project, whose initial ideas started in 2001 and the documents in this repositories are the ideas of the last couple of years, is not and never has been hosted, ampared, endorsed, incubated, funded or received collaboration of any organization, business or entity more than myself. This lack of development environment is the reason of the fuzzy nature of the documents, which are, at most, bookmarks and sidenotes regarding an eventual, but currently inexistent, code or implementation phase. I had neither knowledge of somebody who tried or is trying to implement the concepts stated in this documents.
