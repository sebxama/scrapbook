# Hello, World!

I'm Sebastian Samaruga, software developer from Buenos Aires, Argentina. I'm currently mildly seasoned in the development of business applications in the Java platform and related technologies and stacks.
But what has got me scratching my head a lot in the last couple of years is the "Semantic Web". I know it is a technology paradigm far away from it's realization. But, perhaps, with the advent of Big Data and such it could finally find its niche.
Meanwhile I dump all my head scratching thoughts into this blog and a related GitHub repository I'd like to share. It is an endless work in progress draft and a scrapbook of spare assorted ideas waiting to be realized...

https://github.com/snxama/scrapbook

Note: Going through my most recent attempts of having something concrete for sharing in plain English I realize one mistake I'm committing: I'm trying to describe combustion vehicles (Hypermedia Applications) saying that petroleum exists (Semantic Intelligence).

As long as my post are going I've just got a stack of (incoherent) "analysis" documents as the result of my work. And I had only those until now because I was stuck because of the previously mentioned mistake (ah, and because of my Bipolar Disease maniac episodes...).

I should try to describe applications instead and see how and where fuel should burn properly inside a motion vehicle to generate traction. Every semicolon I write is updated into my GitHub repository, so, sorry if you browse that "scrapbook" and you don't find anything even intelligible.

Best regards,
Seb.
